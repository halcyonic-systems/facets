//! The Compose seam as a protocol: `validate_operational` either projects a
//! [`WorldModel`] into an [`OperationalSpec`] — everything a conservation-
//! faithful simulator needs — or refuses with the complete list of
//! [`OperationalError`]s. There is no partial projection: a model that loses
//! information on the way to execution is rejected, not trimmed.
//!
//! This lifts the gate that previously lived implicitly in bert-compose's
//! `from_world_model` error paths into the kernel crate, so any executor
//! (compose today, Mesa via the bridge, others later) checks the same
//! contract. Representational modes fail loudly by design: Klir's Core and
//! Bunge's Structural lens commits to no flow semantics, so there is nothing
//! to execute — the refusal cites the mode, not a defect.
//!
//! What the contract deliberately tolerates: dead ends (a process with no
//! outgoing flow). The compose engine defines evaporation semantics for them
//! (`dead_ends()` surfaces, the ledger stays exact), so they are a modeling
//! choice, not an execution hazard. Isolated components are different — a
//! component no flow touches would ride along silently, so it is an error.
//!
//! # Interface routing lowers, it does not refuse (bert#108)
//!
//! A flow routed through a boundary interface used to refuse: the component →
//! work-process mapping was an open question. bert#108 settled it (Option 3,
//! identity default): an interface is a component sited in the boundary B, and
//! by Mobus every component recapitulates the fundamental work processes, so
//! the routing *lowers* to a work process already in compose's palette — an
//! [`InterfacePrimitive::Impeding`] filter (with back-pressure) by default.
//!
//! Unparameterized — always, at this mode — the transfer characteristic is the
//! identity: the degenerate zero-width conduit. So the flow still attaches
//! directly to its declared endpoints and runs exactly as if the interface
//! were absent; the lowering is recorded on [`OperationalFlow::interface_routing`]
//! as provenance, nothing more. **This is an EDGE annotation, not a node
//! insertion** (the 4.2 implementation call): the flow keeps its two declared
//! endpoints and gains a marker, rather than splicing an intermediary node
//! between them. The edge form makes the identity default *exactly* the flow
//! attaching directly (same endpoints, same one-tick latency, same ledger) —
//! a spliced node would shift the trajectory by a tick and so would not be
//! observationally equivalent, which the contract requires. The marker is the
//! seam where a future parameterized characteristic would attach (promoting to
//! a real Impeding node); 4.2 ships only the identity default.
