//! Troncale's systems processes, as circuits built from Mobus primitives.
//!
//! This is the single source of truth for the dependency ladder: the palette
//! stamps these as macros (a "Feedback" block drops its primitive loop onto
//! the canvas, visible and editable — NOT a new atom), and the sweep
//! (`sweep.rs`) runs them as machine-demonstrated Linkage Propositions.
//!
//! The honesty is the point. A Troncale process is not a brick — it's a
//! *pattern wired from bricks*, which is exactly what the sweep proved. A few
//! of his processes DO coincide with atoms (Storage = the Buffering
//! primitive; Potential Fields = the gradient flow MODE), and those already
//! live in the primitive palette. The composites below stamp their loops so a
//! beginner can watch the process emerge from the parts.
//!
//! His own dependency ladder is the atomic→composite gradient: roots
//! (Potential Fields, Flows) sit nearest the atoms; higher processes
//! (Feedback → Oscillation → Networks) are increasingly composite.
