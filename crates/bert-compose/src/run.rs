//! The **recorded trace** — the trajectory a circuit traces under `(T, Δt)` —
//! kept OUTSIDE the `WorldModel` (memo A2, `bert-core/src/transition.rs`) and
//! keyed to a content hash of the [`OperationalSpec`] it ran on. A structural
//! edit moves the spec's hash, so a recording no longer matches the model and
//! surfaces as stale: the old trajectory never poses as current.
//!
//! This is an *observer's* record of a simulation, distinct in kind from the
//! 8-tuple's H slot (the authored `System.history`, η): that lives in the
//! model, is serialized, and can condition the system's own transfer; this is
//! pure downstream output that never feeds back and is never serialized. The
//! two must not be conflated — this trace is not the system's "memory" (grounding
//! F1). It is a session artifact, discarded when the app closes.
//!
//! The engine is a discrete synchronous map — one `Circuit::step` advances one
//! Δt. The transfer functions are defined per-Δt, so unit Δt reproduces the
//! engine's native behavior exactly; Δt is the physical duration a tick
//! represents, which is what turns a horizon `T` into a tick count (`T / Δt`).
//! A run is therefore `(T, Δt) →` a recorded trace, which carries the Δt it ran
//! under.
